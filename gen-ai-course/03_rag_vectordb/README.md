# Module 3: RAG & Vector Databases

## Overview

This module covers Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Databases - essential technologies for building production-grade Generative AI applications that can leverage external knowledge bases.

## Topics Covered

1. **RAG Overview** - Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation concepts and architecture
2. **Embeddings & Chunking** - Text embedding techniques and document chunking strategies
3. **Vector Databases** - Understanding and implementing vector databases for similarity search
4. **RAG Implementation** - Building end-to-end RAG pipelines
5. **Retrieval Techniques** - Advanced retrieval strategies including query rewriting, reranking, and hybrid search
6. **RAG Evaluation** - Measuring and improving RAG system performance with comprehensive metrics
7. **Production Issues & Debugging** - Production-level issues, debugging techniques, solutions, and system design

## New: Production Topics

This module now includes comprehensive production guidance:

- **[Common Production Issues](./07_production_issues/common_issues.md)** - Identify and understand issues that occur in production RAG systems
- **[Debugging Techniques](./07_production_issues/debugging_techniques.md)** - Systematic approaches to diagnose and resolve issues
- **[Solutions & Best Practices](./07_production_issues/solutions.md)** - Proven fixes and implementation patterns
- **[System Design for Production](./07_production_issues/system_design.md)** - Architecture patterns for scalable, reliable RAG systems

## Prerequisites

- Python programming basics
- Understanding of LLM concepts (from Module 1)
- Familiarity with LangChain (from Module 2)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be:
- Understand the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Implement text embeddings and document chunking strategies
- Work with popular vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate)
- Build complete RAG pipelines from scratch
- Evaluate and optimize RAG system performance
- Debug and resolve production issues
- Design production-grade RAG systems

## Estimated Duration

12-15 hours of hands-on content (including production topics)

## Hands-on Exercises

Each topic includes:
- Conceptual explanations with diagrams (Mermaid)
- Code exercises with step-by-step guidance
- Solution code for reference
- Quiz questions for knowledge verification
- Real-world use cases and references
