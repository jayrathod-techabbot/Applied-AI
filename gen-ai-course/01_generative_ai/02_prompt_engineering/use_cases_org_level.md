## Prompt Techniques Explained with Real-World Examples

This section explains key prompt engineering techniques with complexity levels and real-world applications.

| Technique | Use Case | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Role Prompting | Tone & expertise control | Low |
| Zero-Shot | Simple tasks | Low |
| Few-Shot | Format replication | Low |
| Chain-of-Thought | Math, logic, analysis | Medium |
| Tree of Thought | Strategic decisions | High |
| Prompt Chaining | Multi-step workflows | High |

---

### 1. Role Prompting - Low Complexity

**What it is:** Assigning the AI a specific persona or role to control tone and expertise.

**Real-World Example - Customer Service Response:**

```
Vague Prompt:
"Explain the return policy."

Enhanced with Role Prompting:
"You are a friendly, patient customer service representative at a retail store. 
Explain the 30-day return policy to a frustrated customer who bought a gift that 
doesn't fit. Use a compassionate tone and offer alternatives."
```

**Why it works:** The role sets the tone (friendly, patient), expertise level (knowledgeable about policy), and context (retail setting), resulting in a more appropriate response.

---

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompting - Low Complexity

**What it is:** Asking the AI to perform a task without any examples.

**Real-World Example - Email Categorization:**

```
Prompt:
"Categorize this email: 'Please update the Q3 sales numbers in the shared 
drive by Friday.'

Categories: Urgent, Request, Information, Spam"
```

**Output:** Request

**Why it works:** Simple classification tasks don't require examples when the task is clear and categories are well-defined.

---

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting - Low Complexity

**What it is:** Providing 2-5 examples to show the AI the desired format or approach.

**Real-World Example - Meeting Notes Summary:**

```
Prompt:
"Convert these meeting notes into action items.

Example 1:
Notes: 'John will prepare the budget report by Tuesday. Team agreed to launch in Q2.'
Action Items:
- John: Prepare budget report (Due: Tuesday)
- Team: Plan Q2 launch

Example 2:
Notes: 'Sarah needs access to the analytics platform. Next meeting is March 15.'
Action Items:
- IT: Grant Sarah analytics platform access
- Everyone: Calendar March 15 meeting

Now convert:
Notes: 'Mike will review the vendor contracts. We need to schedule a demo with TechCorp. Budget discussion moved to next week.'
Action Items:"
```

**Output:**
- Mike: Review vendor contracts
- Sales: Schedule TechCorp demo
- Finance: Prepare budget discussion (Next week)

**Why it works:** Examples show the format (who does what + due dates) so the AI replicates it exactly.

---

### 4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) - Medium Complexity

**What it is:** Encouraging step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy on analytical tasks.

**Real-World Example - Customer Lifetime Value Calculation:**

```
Prompt:
"Calculate the customer lifetime value and explain your reasoning step by step.

Customer Data:
- Average monthly purchase: $150
- Purchase frequency: 4 times per year
- Customer lifespan: 5 years
- Marketing cost per customer: $200
- Product margin: 40%

Show your work:"
```

**Output:**
1. Annual revenue per customer = $150 × 4 = $600
2. Total lifetime revenue = $600 × 5 = $3,000
3. Gross margin (40%) = $3,000 × 0.40 = $1,200
4. Subtract marketing cost = $1,200 - $200 = $1,000
5. **Customer Lifetime Value = $1,000**

**Why it works:** Breaking down the calculation helps catch errors and shows stakeholders the logic behind the number.

---

### 5. Tree of Thought - High Complexity

**What it is:** Exploring multiple reasoning paths in parallel, then evaluating and selecting the best approach.

**Real-World Example - Strategic Business Decision:**

```
Prompt:
"A mid-sized software company has 3 potential growth strategies. Evaluate 
each and recommend the best option.

Option A: Expand into European markets
- Pros: Large market, strong dollar
- Cons: Regulatory complexity, 18-month setup
- Investment: $2M

Option B: Acquire a competitor
- Pros: Instant market share, existing team
- Cons: Integration risk, $5M cost
- Investment: $5M

Option C: Launch new product line
- Pros: Leverages existing customers, lower risk
- Cons: May dilute focus, 12-month development
- Investment: $1.5M

For each option, analyze: Market potential, Risk level, Resource requirements, 
and Timeline. Then recommend the best choice with reasoning."
```

**Output:**
**Option A (Europe):** Medium potential, Medium risk, High resources, Long timeline → 6/10
**Option B (Acquisition):** High potential, High risk, High resources, Fast timeline → 7/10
**Option C (New Product):** Medium potential, Low risk, Medium resources, Medium timeline → 8/10

**Recommendation:** Option C - Best risk-adjusted return

**Why it works:** Exploring multiple paths reveals trade-offs that single-path thinking misses.

- Impact: 30% of orders delayed 2-3 weeks

Strategy C: Expedite shipping from secondary supplier (air freight)
- Pros: Maintains customer commitments
- Cons: Very high cost (3x normal), limited quantity
- Impact: Can cover 30% at high cost

Strategy D: Negotiate partial supply from current supplier
- Pros: Maintains relationship, quality
- Cons: Uncertain outcome, may not succeed
- Potential: 40% of normal supply

For each strategy, evaluate: Customer impact, Cost impact, Risk level, 
and Feasibility. Recommend the best combination."

**Analysis Output:**

| Strategy | Customer Impact | Cost Impact | Risk | Feasibility | Score |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|------|-------------|-------|
| A: Alternate | Low | High (40%) | Medium | High | 7/10 |
| B: Rationing | High | Low | Medium | High | 5/10 |
| C: Air Freight | Very Low | Very High | Low | Medium | 5/10 |
| D: Negotiate | Low | Low | High | Medium | 6/10 |

**Recommendation:** Combine Strategy A + D: Secure alternate suppliers for 50% while negotiating partial supply, accept 15% customer impact on non-critical orders

### 6. Prompt Chaining - High Complexity

**What it is:** Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps where each AI response feeds into the next.

**Real-World Example - Quarterly Business Review Report:**

```
Step 1 Prompt:
"Analyze this sales data and identify:
- Top 5 performing products
- 3 biggest decline categories
- Regional performance summary

Sales Data:
[Quarterly sales numbers here]"

Step 2 Prompt (uses Step 1 output):
"Based on this analysis:
[Step 1 results]

Create a presentation outline for the executive team highlighting key insights 
and 3 actionable recommendations."

Step 3 Prompt (uses Step 2 output):
"Here are our quarterly findings and recommendations:
[Step 2 outline]

Draft the full QBR presentation with:
- 5-slide structure
- Key metrics for each slide
- Speaker notes for the CEO"
```

**Why it works:** Breaking into steps prevents the AI from getting overwhelmed and allows human review between stages.
