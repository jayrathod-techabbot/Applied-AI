This document contains interview questions and answers covering AI logging strategies for Generative AI systems.

## 1. Fundamentals of AI Logging

### Q1: Why is logging different for AI systems compared to traditional applications?

**Answer:** AI logging differs because:

- **Probabilistic outputs**: Need to capture model confidence scores, token probabilities
- **Multi-stage pipelines**: RAG has retrieval + generation stages, each needing logging
- **Cost tracking**: Token usage directly affects billing
- **PII concerns**: User queries may contain sensitive data requiring special handling
- **Agent workflows**: Complex multi-step executions need detailed tracing
- **Quality metrics**: Need to log retrieval quality, response quality scores

### Q2: What are the essential fields to log for AI request logging?

**Answer:** Essential fields include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| timestamp | When request was made |
| request_id | Unique identifier |
| user_id | User identifier (hashed recommended) |
| model | Model used |
| prompt | User prompt (PII masked) |
| prompt_tokens | Input token count |
| completion_tokens | Output token count |
| latency_ms | Response time |
| metadata | Temperature, max_tokens, etc. |

## 2. PII Handling

### Q3: What techniques can be used to handle PII in logs?

**Answer:** PII handling techniques:

1. **Masking**: Replace sensitive data with placeholders
   - Emails → [EMAIL]
   - Phone numbers → [PHONE]
   - SSN → [SSN]

2. **Hashing**: One-way transformation for identification
   - SHA-256 with truncation
   - Preserves ability to identify same user

3. **Tokenization**: Replace with reference tokens

4. **Exclusion**: Don't log sensitive fields at all

5. **Encryption**: Encrypt logs at rest

---

### Q4: What compliance regulations affect AI logging?

**Answer:** Key regulations:

- **GDPR**: Right to erasure, data minimization, consent
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection requirements
- **CCPA**: Consumer privacy rights
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

---

## 3. Cost Tracking

### Q5: How do you track costs in an AI system?

**Answer:** Cost tracking approach:

1. **Log token usage**:
   - Input tokens (prompt)
   - Output tokens (completion)
   - Total tokens

2. **Calculate costs**:
   ```python
   input_cost = (prompt_tokens / 1000) * input_rate
   output_cost = (completion_tokens / 1000) * output_rate
   total_cost = input_cost + output_cost
   ```

3. **Track by**:
   - User/Session
   - Model
   - Time period
   - Feature/Use case

---

## 4. Structured Logging

### Q6: Why is JSON format recommended for AI logging?

**Answer:** JSON format benefits:

- **Parseable**: Easy to query and analyze
- **Searchable**: Works with log aggregation tools
- **Extensible**: Add fields without breaking parsers
- **Standardized**: Works with ELK, Splunk, etc.
- **Type-safe**: Maintains data types

---

### Q7: What correlation IDs should be used in distributed AI systems?

**Answer:** Correlation IDs:

| ID | Purpose |
|----|---------|
| request_id | Unique per request |
| trace_id | Cross-service correlation |
| session_id | Conversation tracking |
| user_id | User identification (hashed) |

---

## 5. Agent Execution Tracing

### Q8: What should be logged for agent workflow execution?

**Answer:** Agent trace logging includes:

1. **Tool Calls**: Which tools were invoked
2. **Tool Inputs**: Arguments passed to each tool
3. **Tool Outputs**: Results from each tool
4. **Decision Points**: Reasoning for action selection
5. **Execution Time**: Per-step timing
6. **Success/Failure**: Outcome of each step
7. **Total Steps**: Number of steps taken

---

### Q9: How does LangSmith or similar tools help with agent tracing?

**Answer:** Benefits of agent tracing tools:

- **Visual debugging**: See execution flow
- **Token tracking**: Monitor usage per step
- **Cost attribution**: Per-step cost breakdown
- **Error tracking**: Identify failure points
- **Performance analysis**: Slow steps identification
- **Collaboration**: Share traces with team

---

## 6. Log Management

### Q10: What are appropriate log retention policies for AI systems?

**Answer:** Retention guidelines:

| Data Type | Retention | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Full logs | 30 days | Detailed debugging |
| Aggregated metrics | 1 year | Trend analysis |
| Audit logs | 7 years | Compliance |
| Error logs | 90 days | Issue resolution |
| Cost data | 2 years | Financial records |

---

### Q11: What is log sampling and when should it be used?

**Answer:** Log sampling:

**When to use**:
- High volume traffic (millions of requests)
- Cost savings on log storage
- Focus on anomalies

**Implementation**:
```python
def should_log(sample_rate=0.1):
    return random.random() < sample_rate

# Always log errors
if is_error:
    return True
return should_log()
```

## 7. Production Implementation

### Q12: How would you implement async logging for AI requests?

**Answer:** Async logging approach:

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from queue import Queue

class AsyncLogger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = Queue()
        
    async def log_async(self, message):
        # Don't block the request
        await asyncio.to_thread(self.queue.put, message)
        
    def background_worker(self):
        while True:
            message = self.queue.get()
            # Write to storage
            self.write_to_elastic(message)
```

**Benefits**:
- Don't increase request latency
- Batch writes for efficiency
- Handle traffic spikes

### Q13: How do you derive metrics from AI logs?

**Answer:** Log-based metrics:

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Error rate | errors / total requests |
| Latency P95 | Percentile of latency_ms |
| Token usage | Sum of total_tokens |
| Cost | Sum of calculated costs |
| Retrieval quality | Average similarity scores |

### Q14: What tools are commonly used for AI log aggregation?

**Answer:** Popular tools:

| Tool | Strengths |
|------|-----------|
| ELK Stack | Full-text search, analytics |
| Splunk | Enterprise, compliance |
| Datadog | APM + logging integration |
| CloudWatch | AWS-native |
| Loki | Grafana integration, cost-effective |

- Query embedding values
- Retrieved document IDs and scores
- Retrieval latency

**Generation Stage**:
- Full prompt (for context)
