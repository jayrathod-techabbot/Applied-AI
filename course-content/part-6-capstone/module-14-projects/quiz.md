### Q10: What is the purpose of re-ranking in the Book Recommender pipeline?

A) Generate embeddings for new books  
B) Improve result relevance by combining search scores with personalization signals  
C) Filter out inappropriate content  
D) Compress the search index  

<details><summary><strong>Answer: B</strong></summary>**Explanation:** Re-ranking takes the initial search results and re-scores them using additional signals like user genre preferences, book ratings, and diversity constraints. This personalizes results beyond what the initial hybrid search can achieve.</details>

---

### Q11: In the Customer Support Engine, what does the PostgreSQL checkpointer in LangGraph provide?

A) Faster inference  
B) Durable session state that persists across conversations  
C) Vector storage for KB documents  
D) Real-time streaming  

<details><summary><strong>Answer: B</strong></summary>**Explanation:** The PostgreSQL checkpointer saves the graph state at each step, enabling durable session persistence. This means conversations survive server restarts, and users can resume sessions. `MemorySaver` is in-memory only and loses state on restart.</details>

---

### Q12: Which evaluation framework is recommended for testing RAG system quality before production deployment?

A) pytest  
B) Locust  
C) RAGAS  
D) OWASP ZAP  

<details><summary><strong>Answer: C</strong></summary>**Explanation:** RAGAS (RAG Assessment) specifically evaluates RAG systems on metrics like faithfulness (does the answer follow from context), answer relevance, context precision, and context recall. pytest tests code logic, Locust tests load, and OWASP ZAP tests security.</details>
