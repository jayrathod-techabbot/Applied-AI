## Answers and Explanations

### Q1: Answer — B) JSON-RPC 2.0
**Explanation:** MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 as its messaging protocol. All requests, responses, and notifications follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification with standard fields like `jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`, and `params`.

---

### Q2: Answer — D) Agents
**Explanation:** The three core MCP primitives are Resources (read-only data), Tools (executable functions), and Prompts (reusable templates). Agents are not a primitive in the MCP protocol.

---

### Q3: Answer — C) stdio
**Explanation:** stdio (standard input/output) is designed for local process communication where the MCP server runs as a child process of the client. It provides the lowest latency for local integrations.

---

### Q4: Answer — B) `initialize` request with capabilities
**Explanation:** The handshake begins with the client sending an `initialize` request containing its protocol version, capabilities, and client info. The server responds with its own capabilities, and then the client sends an `initialized` notification to complete the handshake.

---

### Q5: Answer — B) To allow servers to notify clients when tools/resources/prompts change
**Explanation:** When a server declares `listChanged: true` for a capability, it can send notifications (e.g., `notifications/tools/list_changed`) to inform connected clients that the available list has been updated, prompting clients to re-fetch the list.

---

### Q6: Answer — B) Through JSON Schema defined in the tool's `inputSchema`
**Explanation:** MCP tools define their expected input structure using JSON Schema in the `inputSchema` field. The MCP SDK automatically validates incoming arguments against this schema before passing them to the tool handler.

---

### Q7: Answer — C) Resources
**Explanation:** Resources represent read-only data sources that clients can discover and read. They are identified by URIs and can represent files, database tables, API endpoints, or any other data source.

---

### Q8: Answer — B) The server sends notifications when the resource content changes
**Explanation:** Resource subscriptions enable a publish-subscribe pattern where the server notifies subscribed clients when a resource's content changes. Clients can then re-read the updated resource.

---

### Q9: Answer — C) Enforce read-only defaults and validate all inputs
**Explanation:** Security best practices for MCP servers include enforcing read-only operations by default, validating all tool inputs against schemas, implementing authentication/authorization, rate limiting, and never exposing secrets in tool outputs.

---

### Q10: Answer — B) Standardized protocol enabling interoperability across vendors
**Explanation:** MCP's primary advantage is providing a universal standard so that tools built for one MCP-compatible client work with any other MCP-compatible client, eliminating the need for custom integrations per platform.

---

### Q11: Answer — C) Zod
**Explanation:** The TypeScript MCP SDK uses Zod for schema validation. Zod schemas provide type-safe validation and inference, ensuring tool arguments match expected types at both compile-time and runtime.

---

### Q12: Answer — C) Yes, each connection has its own transport and session
**Explanation:** An MCP client can maintain independent connections to multiple servers. Each connection has its own transport layer (stdio, SSE, etc.) and ClientSession, allowing the client to discover and use tools from different servers simultaneously.

---

### Q13: Answer — C) Sidecar
**Explanation:** The sidecar pattern involves running an MCP server alongside the main application process, providing local tool access. This is common in desktop applications and local agent setups where low latency is important.

---

### Q14: Answer — B) Text, images, and resource references
**Explanation:** MCP tools can return multiple content types: text content (most common), image content (with MIME type), and resource references (pointing to data accessible through the resources API).

---

### Q15: Answer — B) MCP Gateway
**Explanation:** In enterprise architectures, an MCP Gateway acts as a central routing layer that receives client requests and routes them to the appropriate backend MCP servers based on tool names, resource URIs, or other routing logic. It also handles authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging.
