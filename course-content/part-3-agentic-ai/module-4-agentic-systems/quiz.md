## Answers and Explanations

### A1. B - Autonomy to perceive, reason, act, and learn
**Explanation:** While LLMs generate text, agents add autonomy through the ability to perceive their environment, reason about actions, execute tools, and learn from feedback. This agency is the defining characteristic.

### A2. B - Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat
**Explanation:** ReAct interleaves reasoning (Thought) with action execution (Action) and result processing (Observation). This cycle repeats until the agent has enough information for a Final Answer.

### A3. C - Plan-and-Execute
**Explanation:** Plan-and-Execute is ideal for tasks with known steps and dependencies because it creates a complete plan upfront, then executes steps in order, passing results between dependent steps.

### A4. C - Higher output quality through self-critique
**Explanation:** Reflection improves quality by having the agent critique its own output and iteratively refine it. The trade-off is increased latency and cost, not speed or savings.

### A5. B - Delegate tasks to specialized worker agents
**Explanation:** The supervisor acts as a coordinator, analyzing requests and routing them to the most appropriate specialized agent, then collecting and presenting results.

### A6. C - Broadcasting
**Explanation:** The three standard A2A patterns are Request-Response (direct communication), Publish-Subscribe (event-driven), and Streaming (real-time data flow). Broadcasting is not a standard A2A pattern.

### A7. B - Match responses to their original requests
**Explanation:** The `correlation_id` links a response message back to the original request, enabling proper request-response matching in asynchronous communication.

### A8. B - Define the agent's workflow with nodes and edges
**Explanation:** StateGraph is LangGraph's core abstraction for defining workflows. Nodes represent processing steps, and edges define the flow between them, supporting cycles for iterative behavior.

### A9. B - `interrupt()`
**Explanation:** The `interrupt()` function pauses execution and waits for human input before continuing, enabling approval workflows and human oversight at critical decision points.

### A10. C - Level 3
**Explanation:** Level 3 (Conditional Autonomy) means the agent can act independently but only within predefined boundaries and constraints, without requiring per-action human approval.

### A11. C - Multiple perspectives leading to better solutions
**Explanation:** The debate pattern leverages diverse viewpoints by having agents argue different positions, leading to more thoroughly examined and balanced conclusions.

### A12. B - Aggregating and synthesizing independent outputs
**Explanation:** In the swarm pattern, agents work independently in parallel. The main challenge is combining their diverse outputs into a coherent, unified result.

### A13. B - Memory
**Explanation:** Memory maintains both short-term context (conversation history) and long-term knowledge (persistent information), enabling the agent to maintain continuity across interactions.

### A14. B - Tool inputs can be manipulated for unauthorized actions
**Explanation:** If an agent's tool inputs are influenced by malicious user input (prompt injection), it could execute unintended actions. Input validation and sandboxing are essential.

### A15. B - State persistence and recovery
**Explanation:** The checkpointer saves agent state at each step, enabling recovery from failures, conversation resumption, and human-in-the-loop workflows where execution pauses and resumes.

### A16. B - ReAct
**Explanation:** ReAct is designed for uncertain situations because it adapts based on observations at each step, rather than following a predetermined plan.

### A17. B - Help the LLM decide which tool to use
**Explanation:** Tool descriptions are included in the prompt so the LLM can understand each tool's purpose and select the appropriate one for the current context.

### A18. B - The type or purpose of the message
**Explanation:** The `intent` field categorizes the message (e.g., "query", "task", "response", "error", "status"), enabling receivers to route and process messages correctly.

### A19. B - Increased latency and cost due to multiple LLM calls
**Explanation:** Each reflection cycle requires additional LLM calls for critique and refinement, increasing both response time and API costs proportionally to the number of iterations.

### A20. B - `add_conditional_edges()`
**Explanation:** `add_conditional_edges()` allows dynamic routing based on the current state, enabling the graph to choose different paths at runtime based on agent decisions or conditions.
