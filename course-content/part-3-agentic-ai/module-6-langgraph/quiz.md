## Questions

### Q1: What is the primary purpose of LangGraph?

A) To replace LangChain entirely  
B) To build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs using graph-based workflows  
C) To provide a UI for LLM applications  
D) To optimize LLM inference speed  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** LangGraph is designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications using directed graphs. It extends LangChain with cycle support, explicit state management, and human-in-the-loop capabilities.

### Q2: Which Python construct is used to define state in LangGraph?

A) `dataclass`  
B) `NamedTuple`  
C) `TypedDict`  
D) `pydantic.BaseModel`  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** LangGraph uses `TypedDict` to define the state schema. Each key in the TypedDict represents a piece of data that flows through the graph.

---

### Q3: What does `operator.add` do when used as a state reducer?

A) Adds numeric values together  
B) Concatenates strings  
C) Appends new values to existing lists  
D) Merges dictionaries  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** When used with `Annotated[list, operator.add]`, the reducer appends new list values to the existing list instead of overwriting it. This is essential for accumulating message history.

---

### Q4: What is the difference between `add_edge()` and `add_conditional_edges()`?

A) `add_edge()` is faster  
B) `add_conditional_edges()` uses a routing function to dynamically choose the next node  
C) `add_edge()` supports cycles, `add_conditional_edges()` does not  
D) There is no difference  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `add_edge()` creates a fixed transition from one node to another. `add_conditional_edges()` uses a routing function that examines the current state and returns the next node dynamically.

---

### Q5: What does the `END` constant represent?

A) An error state  
B) The termination point of the graph  
C) A special node for logging  
D) The entry point of the graph  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `END` is a sentinel constant that marks where graph execution terminates. Nodes that should conclude the workflow must have an edge pointing to `END`.

---

### Q6: Which method compiles a StateGraph into an executable application?

A) `graph.build()`  
B) `graph.execute()`  
C) `graph.compile()`  
D) `graph.run()`  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** `graph.compile()` validates the graph structure and produces a `CompiledGraph` that can be invoked with `app.invoke()`.

---

### Q7: What is a DAG in the context of LangGraph?

A) A graph with cycles  
B) A directed acyclic graph with no loops  
C) A disconnected graph  
D) A graph with multiple entry points  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) has no cycles — execution flows in one direction from entry to exit. No node can be visited twice in a single execution.

---

### Q8: Why are cyclic graphs important for agents?

A) They improve performance  
B) They enable iterative reasoning (think → act → observe → repeat)  
C) They reduce memory usage  
D) They simplify the code  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Cycles enable agents to perform iterative reasoning loops like ReAct, where the agent reasons, acts, observes results, and reasons again.

---

### Q9: Which checkpointer is best suited for production multi-tenant applications?

A) `MemorySaver`  
B) `SqliteSaver`  
C) `PostgresSaver`  
D) None of the above  

**Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** `PostgresSaver` provides durability, concurrency support, and transactional guarantees needed for production multi-tenant applications.

---

### Q10: What happens when you call `app.invoke(None, config=config)` after an interrupt?

A) The graph restarts from the beginning  
B) The graph resumes from the last checkpoint  
C) An error is raised  
D) The graph skips to the end  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Passing `None` as input tells LangGraph to resume from the last saved checkpoint instead of starting fresh with new input.

---

### Q11: How do you pause execution before a specific node?

A) Use `interrupt()` inside the node  
B) Use `interrupt_before=["node_name"]` during compilation  
C) Use `graph.pause("node_name")`  
D) Use `app.stop("node_name")`  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `interrupt_before=["node_name"]` in `graph.compile()` pauses execution before the specified node runs. This is the breakpoint-style interrupt pattern.

---

### Q12: What does `app.get_state(config)` return?

A) The initial state  
B) The current state snapshot at the last checkpoint  
C) The state history  
D) The graph structure  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `get_state()` returns the current state snapshot, including the state values, next nodes to execute, and checkpoint metadata.

---

### Q13: Which stream mode shows only the state changes from each node?

A) `"values"`  
B) `"updates"`  
C) `"messages"`  
D) `"events"`  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `stream_mode="updates"` shows only what each node changed (the delta), while `"values"` shows the full state after each step.

---

### Q14: What is the purpose of the `Send` API in LangGraph?

A) To send messages to external APIs  
B) To enable parallel execution of nodes  
C) To send emails  
D) To log events  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** The `Send` API enables fan-out patterns where multiple nodes execute in parallel with independent state copies.

---

### Q15: How do you add a node to a StateGraph?

A) `graph.add_node("name", function)`  
B) `graph.node("name", function)`  
C) `graph.register("name", function)`  
D) `graph.define("name", function)`  

**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** `graph.add_node("name", function)` registers a node with a given name and the function that implements its logic.

---

### Q16: What type hint can you use for type-safe conditional routing?

A) `Union`  
B) `Literal`  
C) `Optional`  
D) `Any`  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `Literal["option_a", "option_b"]` provides type-safe routing where the IDE can autocomplete valid route names and catch typos at development time.

---

### Q17: What is a subgraph in LangGraph?

A) A disconnected component  
B) A compiled graph nested inside another graph  
C) A backup copy of the graph  
D) A visualization of the graph  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Subgraphs allow nesting compiled graphs within other graphs, enabling modular, reusable workflows and hierarchical agent architectures.

---

### Q18: How does the `interrupt()` function differ from `interrupt_before`?

A) `interrupt()` pauses inside a node; `interrupt_before` pauses before a node  
B) `interrupt()` is faster  
C) `interrupt_before` requires a checkpointer; `interrupt()` does not  
D) They are identical  

**Answer:** A  
**Explanation:** `interrupt()` is called inside a node function and pauses execution at that exact point, waiting for a response value. `interrupt_before` pauses before the entire node executes.

---

### Q19: What is the purpose of `app.get_state_history(config)`?

A) To get the graph structure  
B) To list all saved checkpoints for time travel  
C) To get the current state  
D) To clear the state  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** `get_state_history()` returns all historical checkpoints for a thread, enabling time travel — replaying or forking execution from any past point.

---

### Q20: Which pattern is best for a supervisor-based multi-agent system?

A) All agents run in parallel  
B) A central node routes to specialized agents using conditional edges  
C) Each agent runs as a separate graph  
D) Agents communicate through external queues  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** In the supervisor pattern, a central routing node examines the state and uses conditional edges to dispatch work to specialized agents, then collects results back.
